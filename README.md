# turn-the-tide

Turn The Tide is a university project

In order to open it, Unity is needed.
To be able to see or use the tile sets, a version of Unity 2018.1.2 or above is needed. But otherwise, any Unity version should work - Unity 2017 or above is recommended!

To see the change history, start with the 'master' branch, then 'AfterGreenlight', then 'FinalDays'. Beware that there might be missing prefabs if you open the Unity project from the latter two branches! The project should work without (major) errors in the 'master' branch.
